# Examples of ReactJS Hooks and Context

This is a simple test code about how to use the new React Hooks like useState, to set state variables and the Context to share variables to our components easily.
It was used Bootstrap just to add some CSS and a Grid System to the examples.

In this example, we search public repositories on a Github account and list it. We can add a repository as a favorite as well.

The bookmarks items are listed on the sidebar. We share the repositories list using Context so we can use this data or update it on all the child components as the example on Search Component and Bookmarks Component on the sidebar.
